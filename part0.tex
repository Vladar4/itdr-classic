Prior to version 2.0 of \game, it contained the ``Appendix C: Class-ic Edition'' --- a remnant of the ``Playtest Edition'' predecessor that instead of the Features and Backgrounds of ItDR had three classes: Warrior, Mystic, and Disciple. Since version 2.0, Appendix~C was removed.\tight

\setlength\parindent{10pt}

This supplement is meant for those who want to include these classes in their ItDR games.
